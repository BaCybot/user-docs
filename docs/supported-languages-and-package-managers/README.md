# Supported languages and package managers

**Note:** The language pages are being restructured and updated on June 22 and June 23. The open source language detail has been moved to each language page.

This page provides an overview of supported languages and package managers across Snyk environments, including feature availability for open source and licensing (Snyk Open Source) and code analysis (Snyk Code).

## Open source and licensing (Snyk Open Source)
