# How the prioritization with Insights works

Snyk AppRisk's prioritization with Insights capability relies on understanding your application context to help you better prioritize your security issues. It does that by understanding how your application is configured and relying on that information to provide you with specific [risk factors](risk-factors/).

* [Assets](assets.md) are analyzed by Snyk prioritization with Insights, focusing on images, Kubernetes resources, and packages to understand how they all interact with each other.
* [Risk factors](risk-factors/) are analyzed by Snyk prioritization with Insights and grouped into four main categories: Deployed, Loaded package, OS conditions, Public facing.
