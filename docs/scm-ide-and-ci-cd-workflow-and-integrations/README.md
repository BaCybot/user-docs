# SCM. IDE, and CI/CD workflow

Snyk supports SCM, IDE, and CI/CD integrations and methods that allow you to implement security at each point in your workflow: importing a Project, writing your code, and building and deployment.

Enterprise plan users have access to all of the functionality. The API and Snyk AppRisk are not available to Free and Team plan users. See [Plans and pricing](https://snyk.io/plans/) for more information.

This section of the documentation provides information about [Snyk SCM](git-repositories-scms-integrations-with-snyk/), [IDE](use-snyk-in-your-ide/), and [Ci/CD integrations](snyk-ci-cd-integrations/).

If you are an Enterprise customer, see [Choose rollout integrations](../implement-snyk/team-implementation-guide/phase-1-discovery-and-planning/choose-rollout-integrations.md) in the Enterprise implementation guide for tips and considerations on import strategies. Snyk suggest reading through the [Deployment recommendations](./#deployment-recommendations-for-git-integrations) also for help with a smooth rollout.

Snyk can automatically create pull requests (PRs) on your behalf to upgrade your dependencies based on scan results. This is compatible with a variety of Snyk integrations. For more information, see [View and understand Snyk upgrade pull requests for integrations](../integrate-with-snyk/git-repositories-scms-integrations-with-snyk/introduction-to-git-repository-integrations/view-and-understand-snyk-upgrade-pull-requests.md).
