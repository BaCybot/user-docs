# Snyk SCM, IDE, and CI/CD integrations

Snyk offers multiple integration types that you can utilize to enhance your current toolset.

When starting with Snyk, we recommend deciding on which primary integrations to implement:

* [SCM (Source Control Manager) integrations](git-repositories-scms-integrations-with-snyk/)
* [IDEs](use-snyk-in-your-ide/)
* [CI/CDs](snyk-ci-cd-integrations/)

As well as how to access Snyk functionality in your developer workflow:

* [Snyk Web UI](../getting-started/snyk-web-ui.md)
* [Snyk AppRisk](../manage-risk/snyk-apprisk/)
* [Snyk CLI](../snyk-cli/)
* [Snyk API](../snyk-api/)

{% hint style="warning" %}
Enterprise plan users have base-level access to all of the above functionality. Free and Team plan users do not have access to the Snyk API or Snyk AppRisk. See [Plans and pricing](https://snyk.io/plans/) for more information.
{% endhint %}

If you are an Enterprise customer, see [Choose rollout integrations](../implement-snyk/team-implementation-guide/phase-1-discovery-and-planning/choose-rollout-integrations.md) in the Enterprise implementation guide for tips and considerations on import strategies.
