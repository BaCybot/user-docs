# Snyk SCM Integrations

You can integrate Snyk with your Git repository to quickly and easily gain visibility across all the [Snyk Projects](https://docs.snyk.io/introducing-snyk/introduction-to-snyk-projects) that you add to the **Projects** list in Snyk.

Snyk Source Control Manager (SCM) integrations allow you to:

* Continuously perform security scanning across all integrated repositories
* Detect vulnerabilities in your open-source components
* Provide automated fixes

Snyk can integrate with the following SCMs to help you track, monitor, and fix the issues and vulnerabilities in your code:

* [GitHub Cloud App](snyk-github-cloud-app.md)
* [GitHub Enterprise](snyk-github-enterprise-integration.md)
* [GitHub](snyk-github-integration.md)
* [GitHub Read-only Projects](snyk-github-read-only-projects.md)
* [GitLab](snyk-gitlab-integration.md)
* [Bitbucket Cloud](snyk-bitbucket-cloud-integration.md)
* [Bitbucket Cloud (Legacy)](migrate-a-bitbucket-cloud-personal-access-token.md)
* [Bitbucket Cloud App](snyk-bitbucket-cloud-app-integration.md)
* [Bitbucket Data Center/Server](snyk-bitbucket-data-center-server-integration.md)
* [Azure Repositories (TFS)](snyk-azure-repositories-tfs-integration.md)
