Dart and Flutter are supported for open-source scans.

Snyk supports testing of Dart and Flutter packages from the Pub package manager using the `packages/{purl}/issues` API, [List issues for a package.](../../snyk-api/rest-api-endpoint-list-issues-for-a-package.md) The endpoint returns known vulnerabilities for the package. &#x20;
