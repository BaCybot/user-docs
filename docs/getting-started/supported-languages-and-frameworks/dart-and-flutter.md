Dart and Flutter are supported for open-source scans.

Snyk supports testing of Dart and Flutter packages from the Pub package manager using the `GET /orgs/{org_id}/packages/{purl}/issues endpoint,` [List issues for a package.](../../snyk-api/how-to-use-snyk-api-endpoints/rest-api-list-issues-for-a-package.md) The endpoint returns known vulnerabilities for the package.&#x20;
