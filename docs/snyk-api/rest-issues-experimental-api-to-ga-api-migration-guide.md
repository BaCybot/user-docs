# REST Issues Experimental API to GA API Migration Guide

## End of Life

On July 19th 2024 Snyk will announce the plan to sunset the REST issues API experimental endpoints [Get all Issues by Org](https://apidocs.snyk.io/experimental?version=2023-03-10%7Eexperimental#get-/orgs/-org\_id-/issues) and[ Get all Issues by Group](https://apidocs.snyk.io/experimental?version=2023-03-10%7Eexperimental#get-/groups/-group\_id-/issues). with an end-of-life on October 21st 2024 in favor of the[ GA REST issues API](https://apidocs.snyk.io/?version=2024-05-08#tag--Issues). The experimental versions we will be sunsetting are the dates range from 2023-03-10, inclusive, to 2023-09-29, exclusive.

**Important information about Experimental APIs**

An experimental endpoint should be considered unstable and regarded as a tech preview. Experimental versions may introduce breaking changes and may be discontinued at any time.
{% endhint %}

## What's New in the GA REST Issues API?

This version of the API delivers:

* **Consistency:** Improved performance and reliability of the REST Issues API
* **Depth:** detailed representations for Open Source packages and fixes
* **Flexibility:** new filters for tailored API responses
* **Usability:** improved pagination and response management, simplifying the API interaction

Snyk understands that migrating to a new API can be a significant undertaking and wants to support you throughout the process. This comprehensive migration guide is intended to facilitate a seamless transition by providing step-by-step instructions, code examples, and best practices to help you smoothly integrate with the new API.

If you are using the deprecated endpoint, Snyk encourages you to review this migration guide and move all your automations over before Monday, October 21, 2024.

## Comparison of Experimental vs GA API

{% hint style="info" %}
**Mapping Experimental API issues to GA API issues**

One of the main differences you will see in the table below is that the format of the ID for an issue changes from URI format (consists of key & scan\_item.id) in the Experimental API to UUID in the GA API.  To match an issue in the experimental api response to the same issue in the GA API response you can use **key** and the **scan\_item.id**. Note that **scan\_item** is part of the **relationships** block and **key** is part of the **attributes** block.

[^1]: The only risk factors presently in the issues API are insights factors.

[^2]: &#x20;For customers with risk score enabled this should be the risk score, but without any risk factors. For customers w/o the risk score enabled, this is the old priority score.

[^3]: As noted above,  to match an issue in the experimental api response to the same issue in the GA API response you can use key and the scan\_item.id. Note that scan\_item is part of the relationships block and key is part of the attributes block.
