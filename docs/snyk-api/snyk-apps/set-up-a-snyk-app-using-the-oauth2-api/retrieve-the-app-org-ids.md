# Retrieve the App Org IDs

Users may connect with a single Organization., or a single Group. Most of the Snyk API endpoints require an `orgid` in the path, which is used for authorizing the action being performed. For more information see [Integrating Apps with Snyk](../../../snyk-api-info/snyk-apps/#integrating-apps-with-snyk).

Snyk recommends you store this value and associate it with the user's details.
