{% endhint %}

With the new Snowflake Data Share integration, your data science, BI and AppSec teams can securely access the same underlying data available in Snyk Reporting, but within your own Snowflake account, unlocking powerful new analytical tools to better understand and visualize Snyk data.

Use this integration to enable teams to rapidly build exploratory and custom analytics using the ecosystem of tools that Snowflake supports. Customers can connect Snyk data to BI tools like PowerBI, Tableau, and Looker data studio or build custom Streamlit apps.

Having Snyk datasets directly in your Snowflake account opens doors for combining Snyk data with additional data sources, which contributes a great deal to the organization-level holistic AppSec view.

## What is Snowflake Data Share? <a href="#what-is-snowflake-data-share" id="what-is-snowflake-data-share"></a>

[Snowflake Data Share](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-sharing-intro.html) allows companies to provide data to their customers in a secure, simple and quick manner. With Snowflake data shares, the data is not exchanged between the accounts; instead, the data consumer is granted with read-only access to the shared database through their own Snowflake account.

### Main use-cases <a href="#main-use-cases" id="main-use-cases"></a>

Snyk Snowflake Data Share can be used for various use-cases and can answer countless security and business-related questions. Some of the these use-cases include:

* Enhance the AppSec posture visibility for the CISO and management team
  * Streamline Snykâ€™s data to your BI platforms and existing security dashboards
  * Reflect performance metrics and KPIs, such as: MTTR, SLA compliance, remediation trend, etc.
* Answer specific questions or surface unique insights
  * Better understand risk **exposure** trends:
    * Example: Track total issues above a specific risk score only affecting certain project collections or tags across all Snyk groups, while filtering for only main/master branches
  * Measure performance of **fix** behavior against SLA
    * Example: Enter custom SLA targets and track towards those goals
  * Build custom **prevention** reporting to understand shift left impact:
    * Example: View trends in preventable Open Source vulnerability across all Snyk groups filtered by specific severities and risk scores
