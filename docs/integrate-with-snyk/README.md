# Integrate with Snyk

This section of the Snyk user docs explains how to set up and use many types of integration with Snyk.  This includes plugins and extensions for using Snyk in your IDE, importing Git repositories, and methods for using Snyk in your CI/CD environment:

* [Use Snyk in your IDE](../scm-ide-and-ci-cd-workflow-and-integrations/use-snyk-in-your-ide/)
* [Git repositories and CI/CD comparisons](../scm-ide-and-ci-cd-workflow-and-integrations/git-repository-and-ci-cd-integrations-comparisons.md)
* [Snyk CI/CD integrations](../scm-ide-and-ci-cd-workflow-and-integrations/snyk-ci-cd-integrations/)
* [Git repositories (SCMs) integrations with Snyk](../scm-ide-and-ci-cd-workflow-and-integrations/git-repositories-scms-integrations-with-snyk/)

Snyk provides plugins for repository gatekeepers and integrations to connect with package repositories:

* [Gatekeeper plugins](gatekeeper-plugins/)
* [Package repository integrations](../scan-using-snyk/snyk-open-source/scan-open-source-libraries-and-licenses/package-repository-integrations/)

Additional integrations support working with Snyk Container and Snyk Iac:

* [Snyk Container integrations](snyk-container-integrations/)
* [Cloud platforms integrations](cloud-platforms-integrations/)

Integrations for [event forwarding](event-forwarding/) allow you to push Snyk platform events directly to certain products on other platforms, enabling you to set up custom alerting, build your own reporting, trigger automation, and more.

[Notification and ticketing systems integrations](jira-and-slack-integrations/) help you work with Snyk in Jira and Slack.

Information is also provided on how Snyk can work with [vulnerability management tools](vulnerability-management-tools/).

Snyk provides alternative reporting tools. For more information, see [Reporting and BI integrations](../manage-risk/reporting/reporting-and-bi-integrations-snowflake-data-share.md).
